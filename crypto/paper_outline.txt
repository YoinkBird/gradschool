  h1:EAP{
    h2:role{
      The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a flexible framework for network access and authentication that allows almost any authentication protocols to be used.
      Within the context of the 802.11i standard, the 802.1X protocol uses EAP to define the EAPOL authentication mechanism.
    }
    h2:operation{
      EAP is a generic transport service that defines message formats which any protocol can encapsulate in order to be EAP compatible.
      The most typical network configuration in which EAP is used is between an EAP Peer (e.g. computer joining the network), the EAP Authenticator (e.g. access point), and the Authentication Server (AS), a server which validates the credentials and authorises network access.
      #TODO: brief segment on RADIUS
      In some configurations, the EAP Authenticator also functions as the Authentication Server, but functionally the same roles are maintained.
      #TODO: what is EAP passthrough mode? book is unclear on this [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748#page-12]
      For an EAP exchange, the EAP_peer connects to the network using a lower-level protocol which implements an EAP-compatible protocoal for the authentication, e.g. 802.1X and EAP-EAPOL or PPP and PPP-EAP.
      During the ensuing authentication exchange, The EAP_peer and the authentication server exchange EAP messages provided by the EAP-compatible protocol chosen for that connection.
      The authenticator submits a Request to the EAP_peer for identity, to which the EAP_peer sends a Response containing its identity.
      The authenticator then submits an EAP message which contains a Type-field defining the EAP-compatible authentication protocol to be used. 
      If the EAP_peer does not support the protocol, it replies with a Response with a 'Nak' and indicates which protocol it would prefer. [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748#page-32]
      The authenticator then either accepts the reqeusted protocol or terminates the connection with a failure message.
      If the EAP_peer supports the protocol, it replies with a Response-message with an identical Type-field and the initiation is considered successful.

      Subsequently, the authenticator and EAP_peer exchange a number of Request-Response pairs determined by ethe chosen EAP protocol.
      Subsquently, the authentication information is exchanged by the authenticator sending a number of Requests to which the EAP_peer sends a number of Responses.
      The Requests and Responses contain information used to define and execute the chosen EAP-compatible authentication method.
      This exchange goes back and forth until the authenticator either authenticates the EAP_peer and transmits an EAP Success message or cannot authenticate and submits an EAP Failure message.
      The EAP conversation is considered complete upon transmission of the Success or Failure message. [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3748#section-2.1]

    h2:role{
      The IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control provides access control functions for LANs.
      In essence, it allows a device on a network to be authenticated without accessing data on the network.
      Within the context of the 802.11i standard, 802.1X is used for authentication and access control.
    }
    h2:operation{
      #TODO: add sub-headers
      The following entities connected to the LAN are involved in the authentication process:
      Supplicant refers to an entity, e.g. a computer, seeking to be authenticated on the LAN.
      Authenticator refers to an entity, e.g. a switch or AP, which handles the authentication procedure.
      Authentication Server (AS) determines whether a supplicant is authorised to access the LAN
      The authenticator passes the supplicant's credentials to the AS to determine whether to provide access to the LAN.
      The authenticator designates the logical entity 'port' as an abstraction referring to a phyiscal connection to the network.
      # TODO: fact-check - wikipedia and sans.org differ slightly, book is very vague
      The port is controlled by the PAE (Port Access Entity) which either sets it to the 'uncontrolled' (unauthorised), state or the 'controlled' (authorised) state. [https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/networkdevs/wired-8021x-security-1654]
      In the uncontrolled state, only 802.1X traffic is allowed, i.e. the supplicant can only communicate with the AS (via the authenticator).
      Upon successful authentication, the port is changed to the 'controlled' state and the supplicant can access other network services (i.e. the data channel).
      EAP authentication mechanism{
        802.11X uses EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol Over Lan) as the authentication protocol between the supplicant and the authenticator.
        A specific group-multicast address is reserved for the authentication procedure, which can be either initated by the supplicant when it joins the network or by the authenticator when it detects a new supplicant.
        The supplicant sends an EAPOL-Start packet to this address to announce intent to authenticate,
        upon which the authenticator replies with an EAPOL-EAP packet containing an EAP-Request Identity message.
        If the supplicant is authenticated, the authenticator sends an EAP-Key packet containing cryptographic keys to the supplicant.
        When the supplicant is ready to leave the network it submits an EAP-Logoff packet indicating intent to be disconnected.

  h1:WPA2+RSN{
    h2:role{
    }
    h2:operation{
      The RSN connects various devices in a network, the station (STA) connecting to a network, e.g. a compture or mobile device,
      the access point (AP) to which the STA connects, 
      the authentication server (AS) which verifies the identity of the STA,
        and the end station to which the STA is connection, e.g. a server.
      RSN has five phases of operation: discovery, authentication, key generation and distribution, protected data transfer, and connection termination.
      The Discovery Phase{
        Discovery allows devices to discover access points (AP). The AP broadcasts messages in order to advertise their presense, which allows a device to discover the AP and associate with it, i.e. join the network.
        At this point the following security capabilities are determined for this connection: the confidentiality and data integrity protocols, the authentication mechanism, and the key management approach.
        The AP dictates the confidentiality and integrity protocols to be used by the STAs as all STAs must use the same protocols and encryption techniques in order to communicate accross the network.
        The particular protocol and key length are referred to as the cipher suite, which can be WEP, TKIP, CCMP, or a vendor-defined method.
        The authentication mechanism and key management approach are defined in the Authentication and Key Management (AKM) suite, which defines the method for the STA and AP to mutually authenticate as well the proceure for generating a root key used for generating other keys.
        The AKM suites can be IEEE 802.1X, pre-shared key (PSK) which has no explicit authentication, or vendor-defined methods.
      }
      The Authentication Phase{
        Authentication is the stage at which the device and Authentication server (AS) verify each others identity.
        801.1X{
          The 802.1X standard is used for the authentication and access control.
          Until the authentication is successful, the AP prevents unauthorised access to the network by only allowing authentication-related traffic between the device and the AS.
          This is described in more detail in its own section.
        }
        MPDU (data) Exchange{
          The wireless standard 802.11 defines the procedure for exchanging data between the STA and AS, where data is technically referred to as the MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU).
          After the discovery phase, the STA is connected to the network via the AP but not yet authenticated.
          The authentication exchange between STA and AS is performed using an EAP Exchange, upon which the AS generates a master session key (MSK) and sends it to the STA; the MSK is also known as the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) key.
          This MSK is used to generate subsequent keys for secure communication between STA and the AP.
          It is important to note that the MSK is not used directly for secure communication.
        }
        EAP Exchange {
          EAP supports several different protocols that can be used between the STA, AP, and AS during the authentication phase.
          A common configuration is to use the EAP over LAN (EAPOL) protocol between the STA and AP and the AAA protocol "Remote Authentication Dial In User Service" (RADIUS) protocol between the AP and AS.
          The EAP exchange using EAPOL and RADIUS is summarised in the following steps.
          Note that the authentication server AS may be referred to as AAA-server, which is a specific type of AS, or RADIUS-server, which is a specific implementation of AS.
          # TODO: is this EAP or EAPOL?
          1. [STA<->AP|EAPOL] The AP issues an EAP-Request/Identity frame to the STA, which then replies with an EAP-Response/Identity frame.
          2. [AP->AS|RADIUS] The AP encapsulates the STA's Response/Identity frame as a RADIUS-Access-Request Packet and passes it to the RADIUS server.
          3. [AS{RADIUS}->AP{EAPOL}->STA] The RADIUS server sends a RADIUS-Access-Challenge packet to the AP, which encapsulates it as an EAP-Request and sends it to the STA.
          The challenge is is a request for additional information from the STA to be used for authentication.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS#Authentication_and_authorization]
          4. [STA{EAPOL}->AP{RADIUS}->AS] The STA sends an EAP-Response to the AS, which sends it to the AS encapsulated as a RADIUS-Access-Request.
          At this point, note that steps 3 and 4 may be repeated multiple times depending on which protocol is being used.
          The exchange proceeds to step 5 once the number of iterations required by the protocol have been reached.
          5. [AS{RADIUS}->AP->{EAPOL}] Once the AS has successfully verified the STA it sends a RADIUS-Access-Accept packet to the AP, which then sends an EAP-Success frame to the STA.
          As of now, the 802.1X controlled port is authorized, but the STA cannot access the data channel until the 4-Way Handshake, to be defined subsequently.
        }
      }
      The Key generation and Distribution Phase{
        Key generation and distribution is the step during which the AP and STA generate and store crytpographic keys for future communication.
        There are two types of keys which are used depending on the type of communication.
        Communication between two entities is secured using pairwise keys, e.g. between an STA and AP,
          and multicast, i.e. group, communications are secured using group keys, e.g. one STA broadcasting to multiple other STAs.

        pairwise keys{
          {
            |[MSK(AAAK) || PSK] (Master Session Key, aka AAA-Key AAAK || Pre-Shared Key)
            |`-- PMK (Pairwise Master Key)
            |    `-- PTK (Pairwise Transient Key)
            |        |-- KCK (EAPOL Key Confirmation Key)
            |        |-- KEK (EAPOL Key Encryption Key)
            |        `-- TK (Temporal Key)
          }
          Communication between two entities, e.g. between an STA and AP, is secured using pairwise keys which form a hierarchy of keys derived from one of two types of master key, the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) or the Master Session Key (MSK).
          In the case of a the Pre-Shared Key (PSK), the key generation and distribution is not part of the 802.11i standard.
          #TODO: is this the one used for home networks?
          In the case of the Master Session Key (MSK), or AAAK, the key generated according to the the 802.1X standard during the previously described EAP authentication phase.
          Second in the generation hierachy is the Pairwise Master Key (PMK), which is derived from the master key. 
          The PMK is a 256 bit key generated by truncating the master key to 256 bits; this means that a PSK is used as-is wherease an MSK may need to be truncated.
          Third in the hierarchy is the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which consists of three subkeys generated by applying the HMAC-SHA1 function to ?a combination of? the PMK, the MAC addresses of the STA and AP, and any cryptographic nonces as needed.
          Integrating the MAC addresses in the key generation helps protect against session hijacking and impersonation (for example, MAC address spoofing would result in a key mismatch).
          The three keys are the EAPOL Key Confirmation Key (EAPOL-KCK), EAPOL Key Encryption Key(EAPOL-KEK), and the Temporal Key(TK).
          The EAPOL Key Confirmation Key (EAPOL-KCK) supports the integrity and authenticity of STA-to-AP control frames during the RSN setup. In addition, it provides access control by proving posession of the PMK as any entity posessing the PMK is authorized.
          The EAPOL Key Encryption Key(EAPOL-KEK) protects the confidentiality of keys and other data during certain RSN procedures.
          The Temporal Key(TK) is used for protecting user traffic.

          [p581,bottom]
          Communication between several entities, e.g. between one STA and several other STAs, is referred to as multicast communication and is secured using a hierarchy of keys derived from on master key, the Group Master Key (GMK).
          The Group Master Key (GMK) is used along with other inputs to generate a Group Temporal Key (GTK).
          The GTK is then transmitted by the AP to the STAs using the already established pairwise keys.
          The 802.11i standard does not specify how to generate the key other than that it should appear random and must be changed whenever a device leaves the network.

        Protected data transfer refers to the secure connection based on the previously generated keys between the STA and AP while the STA communicates with and End Station.
      }

        Connection termination is the process of the STA and AP ending the secure connection set up in the previous stages.
